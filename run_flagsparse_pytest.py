# Ascend uses its own entry points instead of the CUDA-oriented per-operator
# scripts.  Selected only when FLAGSPARSE_BACKEND=ascend; every other backend keeps
# PERFORMANCE_COMMANDS untouched.
#
# Two of them, and the split is deliberate:
#
#   benchmark_ascend.py        measures against a torch-npu baseline, and only
#                              these five operators have one.  Where a baseline
#                              exists, a measured speedup beats a bare timing.
#   benchmark_ascend_probe.py  runs every other operator over the 20-matrix
#                              spread and classifies the outcome -- PASS,
#                              REJECTED, TRITON_COMPILE, MISMATCH, ERROR.  On a
#                              backend where kernels may not lower at all, "did
#                              it run, and if not why" is the measurement that
#                              matters, and the previous mapping simply had no
#                              entry for these operators: every one of them came
#                              back as "no performance command mapping", which
#                              reads the same as a pass.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Backend registry, read from the library rather than restated here.
#
# The harness has to run on CUDA and on every domestic accelerator, and the list
# of those is the library's business, not the runner's.  Importing it means a
# platform added to flagsparse reaches the accuracy and performance phases
# without a second edit here -- and, more to the point, cannot silently disagree
# with what the operators themselves detect.
#
# The fallback list exists so the runner still works against a checkout whose
